# Project Title

Cricket Scorer


This is an online cricket scoring web application API.
⚫Through this API,
⚫ Users can score cricket matches.
⚫ All details of the batsman can be viewed.
⚫ All details of the bowler can be viewed.
⚫ Users can log in and log out.

Limitations:
⚫ This web application API uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI), so users need to manually reload the website after each input, which can be somewhat annoying.
⚫ I am learning Django Channels to convert this web application API to the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI). Once I finish learning, I will start working on how to upload and display data in real-time, Insha'Allah.
